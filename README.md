# Phone Bill Splitter with Streamlit

## Overview

The **Phone Bill Splitter** is a Python application built with Streamlit that helps users split their phone bill among multiple users. This tool is especially useful for roommates, families, or any group of people sharing a phone plan who want to keep track of individual expenses. **Currently, it only supports T-Mobile carrier bills.**

You can access the application [here](https://phonebillsplitter.streamlit.app/).
